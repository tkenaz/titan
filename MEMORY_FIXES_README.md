# Memory Service Fixes - Summary

## ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed (per o3-pro review)

### 1. âœ… Embeddings Configuration
- **Problem**: Mock embeddings were being used
- **Fix**: 
  - Added OpenAI client support with AsyncClient
  - Auto-loads OPENAI_API_KEY from environment
  - Falls back to mock only if API key missing
  - Added openai to requirements.txt

### 2. âœ… Event Bus Integration  
- **Problem**: Memory service not receiving events
- **Fix**:
  - Updated Redis URL in config to match docker-compose
  - Event integration code already exists in event_integration.py
  - Consumer group properly configured

### 3. âœ… Importance Evaluator
- **Problem**: Too strict (0.75 threshold), hardcoded weights
- **Fix**:
  - Lowered threshold to 0.5 in memory.yaml
  - Added configurable weights to memory.yaml
  - Added "plans" feature detection
  - Weights now loaded from config, not hardcoded

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Test

1. **Check everything is working:**
   ```bash
   python3 check_memory_health.py
   ```

2. **Start Memory Service:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.memory.yml up
   ```

3. **Send test events:**
   ```bash
   python3 test_event_publisher.py
   ```

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Changes

### Config (memory.yaml)
```yaml
importance_threshold: 0.5  # Was 0.75
importance_weights:        # Now configurable!
  personal: 1.0
  technical: 0.9
  temporal: 0.9
  emotional: 0.7
  correction: 1.1
  plans: 0.9              # New feature
```

### Code Updates
- `embeddings.py`: AsyncClient, env var support
- `evaluator.py`: Plans detection, configurable weights
- `models.py`: Added has_plans field, plans weight
- `service.py`: Loads weights from config
- `config.py`: Added importance_weights field

## ðŸš€ Status

All three issues from o3-pro's review are now FIXED and ready for testing!

The Memory Service should now:
- Use real OpenAI embeddings for accurate search
- Receive and process events from Event Bus
- Save more memories with smarter evaluation

Next step: Plugin Loader for full autonomy! ðŸŽ‰
